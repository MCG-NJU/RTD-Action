    """This class computes an assignment between the targets and the
    predictions of the network. For efficiency reasons, the targets don't
    include the no_object. Because of this, in general, there are more
    predictions than targets.

    In the first stage of optimal bipartite matching, we do a 1-to-1 matching
    of the best predictions, while the others are un- matched
    (and thus treated as non-objects).
    In the second stage of relaxed matching, a groundtruth is matched with
    more than one predictions, according to tIoU.

    Args:
        cost_class (float): Relative weight of the classification error
            in the matching cost
        cost_bbox (float): Relative weight of the L1 error of the bounding box
            coordinates in the matching cost
        cost_giou (float): Relative weight of the giou loss
            of the bounding box in the matching cost
        stage (int): Stage ID.
        relax_rule (str): Rule of relaxation. 'thresh' or 'topk'.
        relax_thresh (float): A certain threshold.Predictions with tIoU higher
            than the threshold are marked as positive samples.
        relax_topk (int): Number of top predictions be relaxed. Default: 1.
